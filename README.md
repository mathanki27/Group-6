Part 1: Importing files, data wrangling, mathematical operations, plots and saving code on GitHub
====================================================

Description
--------------
This project involves analyzing RNA-seq count data and tree circumference measurements. The RNA-seq dataset, "gene_expression.tsv," contains count data for three samples, allowing for exploration of gene expression patterns. The analysis includes data wrangling, mathematical operations, visualizations, and statistical testing. The second dataset, "growth_data.csv," provides measurements for tree circumference over two decades at control and treatment sites, enabling a comparison of growth trends between the two locations.
